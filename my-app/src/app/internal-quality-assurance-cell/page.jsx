Inspired by Gandhiji’s vision in Hind Swaraj, UBA supports the growth of self-sustained villages using eco-friendly and community-based technologies. The conceptualisation of Unnat Bharat Abhiyan started with the initiative of a group of dedicated faculty members of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, working for a long time in the area of rural development and appropriate technology. India’s 70% of the population lives in rural areas, and this initiative will meet their needs of life, like food, energy, sanitation, education, health, and livelihood, reducing their migration towards their cities and improving growth and job opportunities in their areas.",
